●​
●​
●​
●​

Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS
Redux Toolkit for complex state, React Query for data fetching
Radix UI/Headless UI/shadcn/ui for accessible components
Performance: memoized components, no layout shifts, <100ms interactions
Atomic Architecture: reusable components, custom hooks, shared utilities, DRY
principles
●​ Code quality: comprehensive typing, error handling, documented complex logic (bonus)
●​ Must score ≥ 90 on Lighthouse (mobile & desktop)
Evaluation: Performance optimization (35%), Code structure/reusability (30%), Pixel-perfect UI
(25%), Feature completeness (10%)
Note: Prioritize smooth performance and clean, reusable code architecture. Every component
should be built for reuse across the application.
Deliverables:
1.​ GitHub repo with clean commits
2.​ Vercel deployment
3.​ 1-2 min public youtube video link that shows functionality
4.​ Responsive layout complete down to 320 px width, with auto-layout snapshots attached
to the README
Please note all three deliverables are required, we’ll consider the application incomplete if any
of the deliverables are missing.
